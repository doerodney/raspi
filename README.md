# raspi
This repository includes experimental code used on my Raspberry Pi fleet.

The goal with these projects is to learn a few things.  Configuration will be with Ansible.  Expect to find Python and C code in here.

## xmas
This diretory contains a crawl phase project in which my son and I make a digital signal processor to synchronize Christmas lights to music.  Since this is crawl phase, we will use a Fast Fourier Transform to characterize frequency range into four bins (since we only have four different colored strings of lights).
